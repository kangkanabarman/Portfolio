# Portfolio Start Plan

## Plan:
1. **Verify Component Functionality**: Ensure that all components (Home, About, Projects, Resume, Navbar, Footer) are functioning correctly and rendering as expected.
2. **Check Routing**: Confirm that the routing in `App.js` is set up properly to navigate between different sections of the portfolio.
3. **Preloader Functionality**: Ensure that the `Preloader` component displays correctly during the initial loading phase.
4. **Styling**: Verify that the styles from `App.css` and `style.css` are applied correctly to all components.
5. **Assets**: Ensure that all assets (images, logos) are correctly linked and displayed in the respective components.
6. **Testing**: Run the application to test the overall functionality and ensure that all routes work as intended.

## Follow-up Steps:
- Launch the application to verify that everything is working correctly.
- Make any necessary adjustments based on the testing results.
